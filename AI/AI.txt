mostly used languages in AI are python C\C++ java Matlab lisp
we write code in python and it has to be converted into C++ for increasing run time performance(c++ is faster than python)
to learn ML you should know fundamentals of maths,know python,should be comfortable with libraries like NUMPY,Panda
	and more,should take AI courses,practise a lot.
and it is said that we should start with python because it is easy
data in robots can be stored in 
	embedded platform = inside robots
	                    low latency
	cloud servers = outside robots
					high latency
and yes starlink uses many different programming languages like python C++ etc.
mostly for NLP,sentiment analysis python is used.
	for fraud detection,network security java is used.
and for robotics,speech recognition,games C++ is wiedly used to make them lighter and fast.
some factors that select your language in which you will work are
	domain &
	ranking
