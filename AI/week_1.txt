video 1 : introduction

AI is a developing technology
two types of AI 
    ANI (artificial narrow intelligence):
	it is capable of talking to us recgnise images 
	
	AGI (artificial general intelligence):
	it is capable of doing all the work which a human can doing
	
video 2 : Machine Learning

most used type of ML:
    Supervised Learning:
	A(input) ---> B(output)
	e.g. => spam filtering, self driving cars, speech recognition
	
video 3 : Data:

data is the information needed by the AI to give output (also known as dataset).

e.g.:
	house no.       total no. of people living    kids
	23                  6                           2
	43                  5                           3
	54                  4                           2
	12                  2                           0
	78                  7                           4
	09                  9                           5
	41                  3                           1
	53                  8                           4

types of aquiring data:
1.manual labeling
	in this we collect the images and we build our detector or anything.
2.from observing behaviours
	from websites or surveys we can get user data and other things and we can store it in database.
3.downloading
	it is pretty common download data from a website or parternership.
it is told in the video that when we start collecting data we should start building AI to AI team can give feedback to Data
	team
DATA shold not be thrown to AI team considering it as valuable sometimes it can be less or mre than enough.
data should not be a garbage or else AI will not work properly.
incorrect data may include missing values,incorrect values it should be structured.
