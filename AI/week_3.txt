video 2 : case study,smart speakers:
steps to process command:
	a.trigger word/wakeword detection helps the device to wake up. E.g.-> 'Hey Siri' this is done with ML a to b maping.
	b.speech recognition to take voice input. E.g. -> 'call Mom' this is done with ML a to b maping.
	c.Intent recoginition helps to tell speaker what are intention is example 'tell me a joke' here the command is 'joke'.
		as they have limited set of commands this finds out the command.
	d.execute command for example speaker tells a randomly found joke.
this is also known as AI pipeline.
with  complex command e.g. hey device,set alarm for 10:00 pmprocess are same till Intent recognition after that speaker 
	extracts the time e.g. 10:00 pm and a piece of software sets alarm according to the duration.
key steps:
	trigger word detection
	speech recoginition
	intent recoginition
	a special program to execute the command

video 3 : case study : self driving cars :
	it takes input as images,radar,laser detectionand to detect an object infront of the car.
	it finds the location of them e.g. -> how far they are,they are on left or right side
	now this information goes to a program called motion planning this program plans the path for the car.
	now the path goes to steering,accelerate,brakes
	car detection uses supervised learning A to B input output
	it also uses GPS Maps to travel.
	a major component is trajectory prediction which allows us to predict where the object infront of car will go later.Even
		it uses lane detection,traffic light detection,obstacle detection.
