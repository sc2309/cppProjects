video 2 : Work flow of an ML project:
	INPUT A -----> OUTPUT B.
	when we work with an Machine Learning project we should start with:
		1.collecting data
		2.train model
			do this until it is good enough
		3.deploy model
			remove or update model and its data
	example:- a model that detects cars
	first we should input the images and the model will output a red rectangle around the car.
	at first it may seem worthless but we just need to train it
	and when good enough deploy the model
